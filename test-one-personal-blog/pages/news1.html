                <b>Dave Grohl</b> was pictured dancing and hanging out with
                <b>Post Malone</b>
                at the latter's recent Los Angeles gig - see what went down
                below.
              </p>
              <p>
                The pair have recently become friends, and 2020 saw Grohl praise
                Posty's 'Post Malone x Nirvana tribute' livestream, in which the
                rapper performed a 75-minute set of Nirvana covers. “I was
                honoured,” the band's former drummer said.
              </p>
              <p>
                Post Malone played a show at the Crypto.com arena in LA on
                November 16, and footage has now emerged of Grohl backstage with
                Post Malone, with others in attendance including Orville Peck
                and My Chemical Romance's Frank Iero.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to photos of the two together, footage has also been
                shared of Grohl dancing during the show and singing along.
              </p>
              <p>
                Discussing Post Malone's Nirvana set, Grohl added: “They were
                killing it. So I watched a bunch of it. I was, like, 'That was
                really cool.' I don't get to see other people do Nirvana songs
                often, and he seemed perfectly comfortable with it, and it
                sounded great
              </p>
              <p>
                “Even the die-hard Nirvana people that I know were, like, 'Dude,
                he's kind of killing it right now.'”
              </p>
              <p>
                It was also revealed in the aftermath of the stream that Posty
                had asked permission from Frances Bean Cobain, daughter of the
                late Kurt Cobain, to perform the songs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Taking place in aid of The United Nations Foundation's COVID-19
                Solidarity Response Fund for The World Health Organization
                (WHO), the rapper/rocker performed a 15-song set in celebration
                of the grunge icons.
              </p>
              <p>
                Among the songs he covered were versions of
                <u>'Lounge Act', 'On A Plain' and 'Heart-Shaped Box'</u>. Post,
                who was joined by Travis Barker on drums, Brian Lee on bass and
                Nick Mac on guitar, also paid tribute to the band's late
                frontman by wearing a flowery dress throughout the set.
